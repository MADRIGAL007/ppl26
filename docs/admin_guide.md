## Security Best Practices

### Gatekeeper
The "Gatekeeper" is the first line of defense for the Admin Panel.
- Change the **Gate Username** and **Gate Password** regularly in the Settings tab.
- This is separate from your Admin account credentials.

### Session Security
- Use **HTTPS** in production.
- Do not share your Admin credentials.
- Revoke sessions immediately if you suspect bot activity.
